AN OLD WOMAN WAS SWEEPING HER HOUSE, AND SHE FOUND A LITTLE CROOKED
SIXPENCE. "WHAT," SAID SHE, "SHALL I DO WITH THIS LITTLE SIXPENCE? I WILL GO
TO MARKET, AND BUY A LITTLE PIG."

AS SHE WAS COMING HOME, SHE CAME TO A STILE: BUT THE PIGGY WOULDN'T GO OVER
THE STILE.

SHE WENT A LITTLE FURTHER, AND SHE MET A DOG. SO SHE SAID TO THE DOG: "DOG!
BITE PIG; PIGGY WON'T GO OVER THE STILE; AND I SHAN'T GET HOME TO-NIGHT."
BUT THE DOG WOULDN'T.

SHE WENT A LITTLE FURTHER, AND SHE MET A STICK. SO SHE SAID: "STICK! STICK!
BEAT DOG! DOG WON'T BITE PIG; PIGGY WON'T GET OVER THE STILE; AND I SHAN'T
GET HOME TO-NIGHT." BUT THE STICK WOULDN'T.

SHE WENT A LITTLE FURTHER, AND SHE MET A FIRE. SO SHE SAID: "FIRE! FIRE!
BURN STICK; STICK WON'T BEAT DOG; DOG WON'T BITE PIG; PIGGY WON'T GET OVER
THE STILE; AND I SHAN'T GET HOME TO-NIGHT." BUT THE FIRE WOULDN'T.

SHE WENT A LITTLE FURTHER, AND SHE MET SOME WATER. SO SHE SAID: "WATER,
WATER! QUENCH FIRE; FIRE WON'T BURN STICK; STICK WON'T BEAT DOG; DOG WON'T
BITE PIG; PIGGY WON'T GET OVER THE STILE; AND I SHAN'T GET HOME TO-NIGHT."
BUT THE WATER WOULDN'T.

SHE WENT A LITTLE FURTHER, AND SHE MET AN OX. SO SHE SAID: "OX! OX! DRINK
WATER; WATER WON'T QUENCH FIRE; FIRE WON'T BURN STICK; STICK WON'T BEAT DOG;
DOG WON'T BITE PIG; PIGGY WON'T GET OVER THE STILE; AND I SHAN'T GET HOME
TO-NIGHT." BUT THE OX WOULDN'T.

SHE WENT A LITTLE FURTHER, AND SHE MET A BUTCHER. SO SHE SAID: "BUTCHER!
BUTCHER! KILL OX; OX WON'T DRINK WATER; WATER WON'T QUENCH FIRE; FIRE WON'T
BURN STICK; STICK WON'T BEAT DOG; DOG WON'T BITE PIG; PIGGY WON'T GET OVER
THE STILE; AND I SHAN'T GET HOME TO-NIGHT." BUT THE BUTCHER WOULDN'T.

SHE WENT A LITTLE FURTHER, AND SHE MET A ROPE. SO SHE SAID: "ROPE! ROPE!
HANG BUTCHER; BUTCHER WON'T KILL OX; OX WON'T DRINK WATER; WATER WON'T
QUENCH FIRE; FIRE WON'T BURN STICK; STICK WON'T BEAT DOG; DOG WON'T BITE
PIG; PIGGY WON'T GET OVER THE STILE; AND I SHAN'T GET HOME TO-NIGHT." BUT
THE ROPE WOULDN'T.

SHE WENT A LITTLE FURTHER, AND SHE MET A RAT. SO SHE SAID: "RAT! RAT! GNAW
ROPE; ROPE WON'T HANG BUTCHER; BUTCHER WON'T KILL OX; OX WON'T DRINK WATER;
WATER WON'T QUENCH FIRE; FIRE WON'T BURN STICK; STICK WON'T BEAT DOG; DOG
WON'T BITE PIG; PIGGY WON'T GET OVER THE STILE; AND I SHAN'T GET HOME
TO-NIGHT." BUT THE RAT WOULDN'T.

SHE WENT A LITTLE FURTHER, AND SHE MET A CAT. SO SHE SAID: "CAT! CAT! KILL
RAT; RAT WON'T GNAW ROPE; ROPE WON'T HANG BUTCHER; BUTCHER WON'T KILL OX; OX
WON'T DRINK WATER; WATER WON'T QUENCH FIRE; FIRE WON'T BURN STICK; STICK
WON'T BEAT DOG; DOG WON'T BITE PIG; PIGGY WON'T GET OVER THE STILE; AND I
SHAN'T GET HOME TO-NIGHT." BUT THE CAT SAID TO HER, "IF YOU WILL GO TO
YONDER COW, AND FETCH ME A SAUCER OF MILK, I WILL KILL THE RAT." SO AWAY
WENT THE OLD WOMAN TO THE COW.

BUT THE COW SAID TO HER: "IF YOU WILL GO TO YONDER HAY-STACK, AND FETCH ME A
HANDFUL OF HAY, I'LL GIVE YOU THE MILK." SO AWAY WENT THE OLD WOMAN TO THE
HAYSTACK AND SHE BROUGHT THE HAY TO THE COW.

AS SOON AS THE COW HAD EATEN THE HAY, SHE GAVE THE OLD WOMAN THE MILK; AND
AWAY SHE WENT WITH IT IN A SAUCER TO THE CAT.

AS SOON AS THE CAT HAD LAPPED UP THE MILK, THE CAT BEGAN TO KILL THE RAT;
THE RAT BEGAN TO GNAW THE ROPE; THE ROPE BEGAN TO HANG THE BUTCHER; THE
BUTCHER BEGAN TO KILL THE OX; THE OX BEGAN TO DRINK THE WATER; THE WATER
BEGAN TO QUENCH THE FIRE; THE FIRE BEGAN TO BURN THE STICK; THE STICK BEGAN
TO BEAT THE DOG; THE DOG BEGAN TO BITE THE PIG; THE LITTLE PIG IN A FRIGHT
JUMPED OVER THE STILE, AND SO THE OLD WOMAN GOT HOME THAT NIGHT.

THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME A GOOD MAN WHO HAD TWO CHILDREN: A GIRL BY A
FIRST WIFE, AND A BOY BY THE SECOND. THE GIRL WAS AS WHITE AS MILK, AND HER
LIPS WERE LIKE CHERRIES. HER HAIR WAS LIKE GOLDEN SILK, AND IT HUNG TO THE
GROUND. HER BROTHER LOVED HER DEARLY, BUT HER WICKED STEPMOTHER HATED HER.
"CHILD," SAID THE STEPMOTHER ONE DAY, "GO TO THE GROCER'S SHOP AND BUY ME A
POUND OF CANDLES." SHE GAVE HER THE MONEY; AND THE LITTLE GIRL WENT, BOUGHT
THE CANDLES, AND STARTED ON HER RETURN. THERE WAS A STILE TO CROSS. SHE PUT
DOWN THE CANDLES WHILST SHE GOT OVER THE STILE. UP CAME A DOG AND RAN OFF
WITH THE CANDLES.

SHE WENT BACK TO THE GROCER'S, AND SHE GOT A SECOND BUNCH. SHE CAME TO THE
STILE, SET DOWN THE CANDLES, AND PROCEEDED TO CLIMB OVER. UP CAME THE DOG
AND RAN OFF WITH THE CANDLES.

SHE WENT AGAIN TO THE GROCER'S, AND SHE GOT A THIRD BUNCH; AND JUST THE SAME
HAPPENED. THEN SHE CAME TO HER STEPMOTHER CRYING, FOR SHE HAD SPENT ALL THE
MONEY AND HAD LOST THREE BUNCHES OF CANDLES.

THE STEPMOTHER WAS ANGRY, BUT SHE PRETENDED NOT TO MIND THE LOSS. SHE SAID
TO THE CHILD: "COME, LAY YOUR HEAD ON MY LAP THAT I MAY COMB YOUR HAIR." SO
THE LITTLE ONE LAID HER HEAD IN THE WOMAN'S LAP, WHO PROCEEDED TO COMB THE
YELLOW SILKEN HAIR. AND WHEN SHE COMBED THE HAIR FELL OVER HER KNEES, AND
ROLLED RIGHT DOWN TO THE GROUND.

THEN THE STEPMOTHER HATED HER MORE FOR THE BEAUTY OF HER HAIR; SO SHE SAID
TO HER, "I CANNOT PART YOUR HAIR ON MY KNEE, FETCH A BILLET OF WOOD." SO SHE
FETCHED IT. THEN SAID THE STEPMOTHER, "I CANNOT PART YOUR HAIR WITH A COMB,
FETCH ME AN AXE." SO SHE FETCHED IT.

"NOW," SAID THE WICKED WOMAN, "LAY YOUR HEAD DOWN ON THE BILLET WHILST I
PART YOUR HAIR."

WELL! SHE LAID DOWN HER LITTLE GOLDEN HEAD WITHOUT FEAR; AND WHIST! DOWN
CAME THE AXE, AND IT WAS OFF. SO THE MOTHER WIPED THE AXE AND LAUGHED.

THEN SHE TOOK THE HEART AND LIVER OF THE LITTLE GIRL, AND SHE STEWED THEM
AND BROUGHT THEM INTO THE HOUSE FOR SUPPER. THE HUSBAND TASTED THEM AND
SHOOK HIS HEAD. HE SAID THEY TASTED VERY STRANGELY. SHE GAVE SOME TO THE
LITTLE BOY, BUT HE WOULD NOT EAT. SHE TRIED TO FORCE HIM, BUT HE REFUSED,
AND RAN OUT INTO THE GARDEN, AND TOOK UP HIS LITTLE SISTER, AND PUT HER IN A
BOX, AND BURIED THE BOX UNDER A ROSE-TREE; AND EVERY DAY HE WENT TO THE TREE
AND WEPT, TILL HIS TEARS RAN DOWN ON THE BOX.

ONE DAY THE ROSE-TREE FLOWERED. IT WAS SPRING, AND THERE AMONG THE FLOWERS
WAS A WHITE BIRD; AND IT SANG, AND SANG, AND SANG LIKE AN ANGEL OUT OF
HEAVEN. AWAY IT FLEW, AND IT WENT TO A COBBLER'S SHOP, AND PERCHED ITSELF ON
A TREE HARD BY; AND THUS IT SANG,

  "MY WICKED MOTHER SLEW ME,
  MY DEAR FATHER ATE ME,
  MY LITTLE BROTHER WHOM I LOVE
  SITS BELOW, AND I SING ABOVE
    STICK, STOCK, STONE DEAD."

"SING AGAIN THAT BEAUTIFUL SONG," ASKED THE SHOEMAKER. "IF YOU WILL FIRST
GIVE ME THOSE LITTLE RED SHOES YOU ARE MAKING." THE COBBLER GAVE THE SHOES,
AND THE BIRD SANG THE SONG; THEN FLEW TO A TREE IN FRONT OF A WATCHMAKER'S,
AND SANG:

  "MY WICKED MOTHER SLEW ME,
  MY DEAR FATHER ATE ME,
  MY LITTLE BROTHER WHOM I LOVE
  SITS BELOW, AND I SING ABOVE
    STICK, STOCK, STONE DEAD."

"OH, THE BEAUTIFUL SONG! SING IT AGAIN, SWEET BIRD," ASKED THE WATCHMAKER.
"IF YOU WILL GIVE ME FIRST THAT GOLD WATCH AND CHAIN IN YOUR HAND." THE
JEWELLER GAVE THE WATCH AND CHAIN. THE BIRD TOOK IT IN ONE FOOT, THE SHOES
IN THE OTHER, AND, AFTER HAVING REPEATED THE SONG, FLEW AWAY TO WHERE THREE
MILLERS WERE PICKING A MILLSTONE. THE BIRD PERCHED ON A TREE AND SANG:

  "MY WICKED MOTHER SLEW ME,
  MY DEAR FATHER ATE ME,
  MY LITTLE BROTHER WHOM I LOVE
  SITS BELOW, AND I SING ABOVE
    STICK!"

THEN ONE OF THE MEN PUT DOWN HIS TOOL AND LOOKED UP FROM HIS WORK,

  "STOCK!"

THEN THE SECOND MILLER'S MAN LAID ASIDE HIS TOOL AND LOOKED UP,

  "STONE!"

THEN THE THIRD MILLER'S MAN LAID DOWN HIS TOOL AND LOOKED UP,

  "DEAD!"

THEN ALL THREE CRIED OUT WITH ONE VOICE: "OH, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SONG! SING
IT, SWEET BIRD, AGAIN." "IF YOU WILL PUT THE MILLSTONE ROUND MY NECK," SAID
THE BIRD. THE MEN DID WHAT THE BIRD WANTED AND AWAY TO THE TREE IT FLEW WITH
THE MILLSTONE ROUND ITS NECK, THE RED SHOES IN ONE FOOT, AND THE GOLD WATCH
AND CHAIN IN THE OTHER. IT SANG THE SONG AND THEN FLEW HOME. IT RATTLED THE
MILLSTONE AGAINST THE EAVES OF THE HOUSE, AND THE STEPMOTHER SAID: "IT
THUNDERS." THEN THE LITTLE BOY RAN OUT TO SEE THE THUNDER, AND DOWN DROPPED
THE RED SHOES AT HIS FEET. IT RATTLED THE MILLSTONE AGAINST THE EAVES OF THE
HOUSE ONCE MORE, AND THE STEPMOTHER SAID AGAIN: "IT THUNDERS." THEN THE
FATHER RAN OUT AND DOWN FELL THE CHAIN ABOUT HIS NECK.

IN RAN FATHER AND SON, LAUGHING AND SAYING, "SEE, WHAT FINE THINGS THE
THUNDER HAS BROUGHT US!" THEN THE BIRD RATTLED THE MILLSTONE AGAINST THE
EAVES OF THE HOUSE A THIRD TIME; AND THE STEPMOTHER SAID: "IT THUNDERS
AGAIN, PERHAPS THE THUNDER HAS BROUGHT SOMETHING FOR ME," AND SHE RAN OUT;
BUT THE MOMENT SHE STEPPED OUTSIDE THE DOOR, DOWN FELL THE MILLSTONE ON HER
HEAD; AND SO SHE DIED.

3. 89012
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A FARMER AND HIS WIFE WHO HAD ONE DAUGHTER, AND
SHE WAS COURTED BY A GENTLEMAN. EVERY EVENING HE USED TO COME AND SEE HER,
AND STOP TO SUPPER AT THE FARMHOUSE, AND THE DAUGHTER USED TO BE SENT DOWN
INTO THE CELLAR TO DRAW THE BEER FOR SUPPER. SO ONE EVENING SHE HAD GONE
DOWN TO DRAW THE BEER, AND SHE HAPPENED TO LOOK UP AT THE CEILING WHILE SHE
WAS DRAWING, AND SHE SAW A MALLET STUCK IN ONE OF THE BEAMS. IT MUST HAVE
BEEN THERE A LONG, LONG TIME, BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER SHE HAD NEVER NOTICED IT
BEFORE, AND SHE BEGAN A- THINKING. AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS TO
HAVE THAT MALLET THERE, FOR SHE SAID TO HERSELF: "SUPPOSE HIM AND ME WAS TO
BE MARRIED, AND WE WAS TO HAVE A SON, AND HE WAS TO GROW UP TO BE A MAN, AND
COME DOWN INTO THE CELLAR TO DRAW THE BEER, LIKE AS I'M DOING NOW, AND THE
MALLET WAS TO FALL ON HIS HEAD AND KILL HIM, WHAT A DREADFUL THING IT WOULD
BE!" AND SHE PUT DOWN THE CANDLE AND THE JUG, AND SAT HERSELF DOWN AND BEGAN
A-CRYING.

WELL, THEY BEGAN TO WONDER UPSTAIRS HOW IT WAS THAT SHE WAS SO LONG DRAWING
THE BEER, AND HER MOTHER WENT DOWN TO SEE AFTER HER, AND SHE FOUND HER
SITTING ON THE SETTLE CRYING, AND THE BEER RUNNING OVER THE FLOOR. "WHY,
WHATEVER IS THE MATTER?" SAID HER MOTHER. "OH, MOTHER!" SAYS SHE, "LOOK AT
THAT HORRID MALLET! SUPPOSE WE WAS TO BE MARRIED, AND WAS TO HAVE A SON, AND
HE WAS TO GROW UP, AND WAS TO COME DOWN TO THE CELLAR TO DRAW THE BEER, AND
THE MALLET WAS TO FALL ON HIS HEAD AND KILL HIM, WHAT A DREADFUL THING IT
WOULD BE!" "DEAR, DEAR! WHAT A DREADFUL THING IT WOULD BE!" SAID THE MOTHER,
AND SHE SAT HER DOWN ASIDE OF THE DAUGHTER AND STARTED A-CRYING TOO. THEN
AFTER A BIT THE FATHER BEGAN TO WONDER THAT THEY DIDN'T COME BACK, AND HE
WENT DOWN INTO THE CELLAR TO LOOK AFTER THEM HIMSELF, AND THERE THEY TWO SAT
A- CRYING, AND THE BEER RUNNING ALL OVER THE FLOOR. "WHATEVER IS THE
MATTER?" SAYS HE. "WHY," SAYS THE MOTHER, "LOOK AT THAT HORRID MALLET. JUST
SUPPOSE, IF OUR DAUGHTER AND HER SWEETHEART WAS TO BE MARRIED, AND WAS TO
HAVE A SON, AND HE WAS TO GROW UP, AND WAS TO COME DOWN INTO THE CELLAR TO
DRAW THE BEER, AND THE MALLET WAS TO FALL ON HIS HEAD AND KILL HIM, WHAT A
DREADFUL THING IT WOULD BE!" "DEAR, DEAR, DEAR! SO IT WOULD!" SAID THE
FATHER, AND HE SAT HIMSELF DOWN ASIDE OF THE OTHER TWO, AND STARTED
A-CRYING.

NOW THE GENTLEMAN GOT TIRED OF STOPPING UP IN THE KITCHEN BY HIMSELF, AND AT
LAST HE WENT DOWN INTO THE CELLAR TOO, TO SEE WHAT THEY WERE AFTER; AND
THERE THEY THREE SAT A-CRYING SIDE BY SIDE, AND THE BEER RUNNING ALL OVER
THE FLOOR. AND HE RAN STRAIGHT AND TURNED THE TAP. THEN HE SAID: "WHATEVER
ARE YOU THREE DOING, SITTING THERE CRYING, AND LETTING THE BEER RUN ALL OVER
THE FLOOR?"

"OH!" SAYS THE FATHER, "LOOK AT THAT HORRID MALLET! SUPPOSE YOU AND OUR
DAUGHTER WAS TO BE MARRIED, AND WAS TO HAVE A SON, AND HE WAS TO GROW UP,
AND WAS TO COME DOWN INTO THE CELLAR TO DRAW THE BEER, AND THE MALLET WAS TO
FALL ON HIS HEAD AND KILL HIM!" AND THEN THEY ALL STARTED A-CRYING WORSE
THAN BEFORE. BUT THE GENTLEMAN BURST OUT A- LAUGHING, AND REACHED UP AND
PULLED OUT THE MALLET, AND THEN HE SAID: "I'VE TRAVELLED MANY MILES, AND I
NEVER MET THREE SUCH BIG SILLIES AS YOU THREE BEFORE; AND NOW I SHALL START
OUT ON MY TRAVELS AGAIN, AND WHEN I CAN FIND THREE BIGGER SILLIES THAN YOU
THREE, THEN I'LL COME BACK AND MARRY YOUR DAUGHTER." SO HE WISHED THEM
GOOD-BYE, AND STARTED OFF ON HIS TRAVELS, AND LEFT THEM ALL CRYING BECAUSE
THE GIRL HAD LOST HER SWEETHEART.

WELL, HE SET OUT, AND HE TRAVELLED A LONG WAY, AND AT LAST HE CAME TO A
WOMAN'S COTTAGE THAT HAD SOME GRASS GROWING ON THE ROOF. AND THE WOMAN WAS
TRYING TO GET HER COW TO GO UP A LADDER TO THE GRASS, AND THE POOR THING
DURST NOT GO. SO THE GENTLEMAN ASKED THE WOMAN WHAT SHE WAS DOING. "WHY,
LOOKYE," SHE SAID, "LOOK AT ALL THAT BEAUTIFUL GRASS. I'M GOING TO GET THE
COW ON TO THE ROOF TO EAT IT. SHE'LL BE QUITE SAFE, FOR I SHALL TIE A STRING
ROUND HER NECK, AND PASS IT DOWN THE CHIMNEY, AND TIE IT TO MY WRIST AS I GO
ABOUT THE HOUSE, SO SHE CAN'T FALL OFF WITHOUT MY KNOWING IT." "OH, YOU POOR
SILLY!" SAID THE GENTLEMAN, "YOU SHOULD CUT THE GRASS AND THROW IT DOWN TO
THE COW!" BUT THE WOMAN THOUGHT IT WAS EASIER TO GET THE COW UP THE LADDER
THAN TO GET THE GRASS DOWN, SO SHE PUSHED HER AND COAXED HER AND GOT HER UP,
AND TIED A STRING ROUND HER NECK, AND PASSED IT DOWN THE CHIMNEY, AND
FASTENED IT TO HER OWN WRIST. AND THE GENTLEMAN WENT ON HIS WAY, BUT HE
HADN'T GONE FAR WHEN THE COW TUMBLED OFF THE ROOF, AND HUNG BY THE STRING
TIED ROUND HER NECK, AND IT STRANGLED HER. AND THE WEIGHT OF THE COW TIED TO
HER WRIST PULLED THE WOMAN UP THE CHIMNEY, AND SHE STUCK FAST HALF-WAY AND
WAS SMOTHERED IN THE SOOT.

WELL, THAT WAS ONE BIG SILLY.

AND THE GENTLEMAN WENT ON AND ON, AND HE WENT TO AN INN TO STOP THE NIGHT,
AND THEY WERE SO FULL AT THE INN THAT THEY HAD TO PUT HIM IN A DOUBLE-BEDDED
ROOM, AND ANOTHER TRAVELLER WAS TO SLEEP IN THE OTHER BED. THE OTHER MAN WAS
A VERY PLEASANT FELLOW, AND THEY GOT VERY FRIENDLY TOGETHER; BUT IN THE
MORNING, WHEN THEY WERE BOTH GETTING UP, THE GENTLEMAN WAS SURPRISED TO SEE
THE OTHER HANG HIS TROUSERS ON THE KNOBS OF THE CHEST OF DRAWERS AND RUN
ACROSS THE ROOM AND TRY TO JUMP INTO THEM, AND HE TRIED OVER AND OVER AGAIN,
AND COULDN'T MANAGE IT; AND THE GENTLEMAN WONDERED WHATEVER HE WAS DOING IT
FOR. AT LAST HE STOPPED AND WIPED HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF. "OH DEAR,"
HE SAYS, "I DO THINK TROUSERS ARE THE MOST AWKWARDEST KIND OF CLOTHES THAT
EVER WERE. I CAN'T THINK WHO COULD HAVE INVENTED SUCH THINGS. IT TAKES ME
THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR TO GET INTO MINE EVERY MORNING, AND I GET SO HOT!
HOW DO YOU MANAGE YOURS?" SO THE GENTLEMAN BURST OUT A-LAUGHING, AND SHOWED
HIM HOW TO PUT THEM ON; AND HE WAS VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM, AND SAID HE
NEVER SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF DOING IT THAT WAY.

SO THAT WAS ANOTHER BIG SILLY.

THEN THE GENTLEMAN WENT ON HIS TRAVELS AGAIN; AND HE CAME TO A VILLAGE, AND
OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE THERE WAS A POND, AND ROUND THE POND WAS A CROWD OF
PEOPLE. AND THEY HAD GOT RAKES, AND BROOMS, AND PITCHFORKS, REACHING INTO
THE POND; AND THE GENTLEMAN ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER. "WHY," THEY SAY,
"MATTER ENOUGH! MOON'S TUMBLED INTO THE POND, AND WE CAN'T RAKE HER OUT
ANYHOW!" SO THE GENTLEMAN BURST OUT A- LAUGHING, AND TOLD THEM TO LOOK UP
INTO THE SKY, AND THAT IT WAS ONLY THE SHADOW IN THE WATER. BUT THEY
WOULDN'T LISTEN TO HIM, AND ABUSED HIM SHAMEFULLY, AND HE GOT AWAY AS QUICK
AS HE COULD.

SO THERE WAS A WHOLE LOT OF SILLIES BIGGER THAN THEM THREE SILLIES AT HOME.
SO THE GENTLEMAN TURNED BACK HOME AGAIN AND MARRIED THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER,
AND IF THEY DIDN'T LIVE HAPPY FOR EVER AFTER, THAT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU
OR ME.

4. 98765
THERE WAS AN OLD SOW WITH THREE LITTLE PIGS, AND AS SHE HAD NOT ENOUGH TO
KEEP THEM, SHE SENT THEM OUT TO SEEK THEIR FORTUNE. THE FIRST THAT WENT OFF
MET A MAN WITH A BUNDLE OF STRAW, AND SAID TO HIM:

"PLEASE, MAN, GIVE ME THAT STRAW TO BUILD ME A HOUSE."

WHICH THE MAN DID, AND THE LITTLE PIG BUILT A HOUSE WITH IT. PRESENTLY CAME
ALONG A WOLF, AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR, AND SAID:

"LITTLE PIG, LITTLE PIG, LET ME COME IN."

TO WHICH THE PIG ANSWERED:

"NO, NO, BY THE HAIR OF MY CHINY CHIN CHIN."

THE WOLF THEN ANSWERED TO THAT:

"THEN I'LL HUFF, AND I'LL PUFF, AND I'LL BLOW YOUR HOUSE IN."

SO HE HUFFED, AND HE PUFFED, AND HE BLEW HIS HOUSE IN, AND ATE UP THE LITTLE
PIG.

THE SECOND LITTLE PIG MET A MAN WITH A BUNDLE OF FURZE, AND SAID:

"PLEASE, MAN, GIVE ME THAT FURZE TO BUILD A HOUSE."

WHICH THE MAN DID, AND THE PIG BUILT HIS HOUSE. THEN ALONG CAME THE WOLF,
AND SAID:

"LITTLE PIG, LITTLE PIG, LET ME COME IN."

"NO, NO, BY THE HAIR OF MY CHINY CHIN CHIN."

"THEN I'LL PUFF, AND I'LL HUFF, AND I'LL BLOW YOUR HOUSE IN."

SO HE HUFFED, AND HE PUFFED, AND HE PUFFED, AND HE HUFFED, AND AT LAST HE
BLEW THE HOUSE DOWN, AND HE ATE UP THE LITTLE PIG.

THE THIRD LITTLE PIG MET A MAN WITH A LOAD OF BRICKS, AND SAID:

"PLEASE, MAN, GIVE ME THOSE BRICKS TO BUILD A HOUSE WITH."

SO THE MAN GAVE HIM THE BRICKS, AND HE BUILT HIS HOUSE WITH THEM. SO THE
WOLF CAME, AS HE DID TO THE OTHER LITTLE PIGS, AND SAID:

"LITTLE PIG, LITTLE PIG, LET ME COME IN."

"NO, NO, BY THE HAIR OF MY CHINY CHIN CHIN."

"THEN I'LL HUFF, AND I'LL PUFF, AND I'LL BLOW YOUR HOUSE IN."

WELL, HE HUFFED, AND HE PUFFED, AND HE HUFFED AND HE PUFFED, AND HE PUFFED
AND HUFFED; BUT HE COULD NOT GET THE HOUSE DOWN. WHEN HE FOUND THAT HE COULD
NOT, WITH ALL HIS HUFFING AND PUFFING, BLOW THE HOUSE DOWN, HE SAID:

"LITTLE PIG, I KNOW WHERE THERE IS A NICE FIELD OF TURNIPS."

"WHERE?" SAID THE LITTLE PIG.

"OH, IN MR. SMITH'S HOME-FIELD, AND IF YOU WILL BE READY TOMORROW MORNING I
WILL CALL FOR YOU, AND WE WILL GO TOGETHER, AND GET SOME FOR DINNER."

"VERY WELL," SAID THE LITTLE PIG, "I WILL BE READY. WHAT TIME DO YOU MEAN TO
GO?"

"OH, AT SIX O'CLOCK."

WELL, THE LITTLE PIG GOT UP AT FIVE, AND GOT THE TURNIPS BEFORE THE WOLF
CAME (WHICH HE DID ABOUT SIX) AND WHO SAID:

"LITTLE PIG, ARE YOU READY?"

THE LITTLE PIG SAID: "READY! I HAVE BEEN AND COME BACK AGAIN, AND GOT A NICE
POTFUL FOR DINNER."

THE WOLF FELT VERY ANGRY AT THIS, BUT THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD BE UP TO THE
LITTLE PIG SOMEHOW OR OTHER, SO HE SAID:

"LITTLE PIG, I KNOW WHERE THERE IS A NICE APPLE-TREE."

"WHERE?" SAID THE PIG.

"DOWN AT MERRY-GARDEN," REPLIED THE WOLF, "AND IF YOU WILL NOT DECEIVE ME I
WILL COME FOR YOU, AT FIVE O'CLOCK TOMORROW AND GET SOME APPLES."

WELL, THE LITTLE PIG BUSTLED UP THE NEXT MORNING AT FOUR O'CLOCK, AND WENT
OFF FOR THE APPLES, HOPING TO GET BACK BEFORE THE WOLF CAME; BUT HE HAD
FURTHER TO GO, AND HAD TO CLIMB THE TREE, SO THAT JUST AS HE WAS COMING DOWN
FROM IT, HE SAW THE WOLF COMING, WHICH, AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE, FRIGHTENED HIM
VERY MUCH. WHEN THE WOLF CAME UP HE SAID:

"LITTLE PIG, WHAT! ARE YOU HERE BEFORE ME? ARE THEY NICE APPLES?"

"YES, VERY," SAID THE LITTLE PIG. "I WILL THROW YOU DOWN ONE."

AND HE THREW IT SO FAR, THAT, WHILE THE WOLF WAS GONE TO PICK IT UP, THE
LITTLE PIG JUMPED DOWN AND RAN HOME. THE NEXT DAY THE WOLF CAME AGAIN, AND
SAID TO THE LITTLE PIG:

"LITTLE PIG, THERE IS A FAIR AT SHANKLIN THIS AFTERNOON, WILL YOU GO?"

"OH YES," SAID THE PIG, "I WILL GO; WHAT TIME SHALL YOU BE READY?"

"AT THREE," SAID THE WOLF. SO THE LITTLE PIG WENT OFF BEFORE THE TIME AS
USUAL, AND GOT TO THE FAIR, AND BOUGHT A BUTTER-CHURN, WHICH HE WAS GOING
HOME WITH, WHEN HE SAW THE WOLF COMING. THEN HE COULD NOT TELL WHAT TO DO.
SO HE GOT INTO THE CHURN TO HIDE, AND BY SO DOING TURNED IT ROUND, AND IT
ROLLED DOWN THE HILL WITH THE PIG IN IT, WHICH FRIGHTENED THE WOLF SO MUCH,
THAT HE RAN HOME WITHOUT GOING TO THE FAIR. HE WENT TO THE LITTLE PIG'S
HOUSE, AND TOLD HIM HOW FRIGHTENED HE HAD BEEN BY A GREAT ROUND THING WHICH
CAME DOWN THE HILL PAST HIM. THEN THE LITTLE PIG SAID:

"HAH, I FRIGHTENED YOU, THEN. I HAD BEEN TO THE FAIR AND BOUGHT A
BUTTER-CHURN, AND WHEN I SAW YOU, I GOT INTO IT, AND ROLLED DOWN THE HILL."

THEN THE WOLF WAS VERY ANGRY INDEED, AND DECLARED HE WOULD EAT UP THE LITTLE
PIG, AND THAT HE WOULD GET DOWN THE CHIMNEY AFTER HIM. WHEN THE LITTLE PIG
SAW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT, HE HUNG ON THE POT FULL OF WATER, AND MADE UP A
BLAZING FIRE, AND, JUST AS THE WOLF WAS COMING DOWN, TOOK OFF THE COVER, AND
IN FELL THE WOLF; SO THE LITTLE PIG PUT ON THE COVER AGAIN IN AN INSTANT,
BOILED HIM UP, AND ATE HIM FOR SUPPER, AND LIVED HAPPY EVER AFTERWARDS.
